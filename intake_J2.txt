“We are currently only taking housing applications if a client is at risk of being evicted from a HUD-
assisted rental unit. All other housing applications are referred to our office through the Right to
Counsel Program of Kansas City. We do not currently have capacity for non-RTC or non-HUD assisted
rental property cases.”
Script:
1. What city do you live in?
2. Has your landlord filed an eviction against you in court?
a. If the caller lives in Kansas City and an eviction has been filed, we provide information
on how to apply for the Right to Counsel program.

3. If the caller does not live in Kansas City, we ask if their rent is subsidized, or they live in an
income restricted property.
a. If the property is not HUD-assisted rental unit, we provide information for the Missouri
Bar to look for a private attorney and other relevant resources (rental and utility
assistance).
b. If the property is a HUD-assisted rental unit and the client is at risk or facing eviction, we
will complete an application.
